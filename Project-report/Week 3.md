# Week 3: 21th May to 28th May 
- Added GitHub Action workflow to " https://github.com/shrish-shete20/translations " and " https://github.com/shrish-shete20/rcontribution-messages "
- Major time was spent on resolving errors in the workflow file.
- While writing the workflow file for " https://github.com/shrish-shete20/translations" , following were the concerns :
  - I was trying to make the file according to " https://github.com/RamiKrispin/deploy-flex-actions#set-automation-with-github-actions " ,but didn't work out.
  - Learnt about docker environment, but used runners instead of docker. It might be useful in future works. 
  - Error while installing packages :
