# Week 9 : 14th July to 21th July
- Created Library page to the Dashboard "https://shrish-shete20.github.io/weblate/New-Dashboard.html#library" .
- Added 3 plots to the page.
- Plots:
    - First plot (Libraries): This plot displays the translations of each library for each language. The user can select a library from the menu box and see the corresponding translations for each language. This plot helps to compare the quality and consistency of the translations across different languages.
    - Second plot (Library Translation Status): These plots show the translation status of each library, i.e., the total number of words to be translated, the number of words that are translated, untranslated, or fuzzy. These plots help to identify the progress and gaps in the translation process for each library.
    - Third plot (Component Translation Status): These plots show the status of the three components (R, C, English) and the libraries available in those components. They also show the total number of words to be translated and the number of words that are translated for each library. These plots help to evaluate the coverage and completeness of the translations for each component and library.
- Next week I will Complete the Translation page.
