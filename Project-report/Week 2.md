# Week 2: 13th May to 20th May 
- Learned about GitHub Actions.
- Learned about GitHub pages. Understood Github pages are only restricted to hosting static websites. Capable of serving static websites from GitHub's CDN (content delivery network (CDN)) only. It can be triggered manually or automatically but cannot be used to automate tasks.
- Binged many Youtube tutorials to understand yaml files required for GitHub workflows.
- A custom JS file can also be used instead of the yaml file to generate workflows in the repository.
- Tried the workflows on the repository my friend and I made. (This was done to check for pull requests). Repo: https://github.com/omsv135/omsv135.github.io 
https://github.com/shrish-shete20/omsv135.github.io
- Firstly we tried applying Github pages as Environment as the main workflow .
- Then we tried writing some code in GitHub Workflows on the deployment of static HTML. eg, https://github.com/omsv135/omsv135.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/static.yml
- Made files like action.yaml, which can be used for continuous Integration in GitHub Actions.
