# Week 7 : 27th June to 3rd July
- Created a leaderboard Dashboard "https://github.com/shrish-shete20/weblate/blob/main/New-Dashboard.Rmd" using CSS and JavaScript and reactable library.
- Explored about DT library(data table),but it doesn't provide custom CSS and JavaScript.(Hence dropped)
- Added gauge component which would show that is there a emergency of the users to be active.
- Added value boxes which would give an overview of number of active users,inactive users and users who haven't started yet.
- Created plots between top 10 people doing translations with the number of translations they did.This plot has features like Zoom in ,out rangeSlider and each name is of different colour.
- Next week I will try to complete 2 pages in Dashboard (specifically Languages and Packages).
